## MyTaskEasier: Task Management App

MyTaskEasier is a mobile application built with Android Studio and Kotlin that helps you manage your tasks efficiently. It allows you to:

* Add new tasks with details like name, description, priority, and deadline.
* View a list of existing tasks in a user-friendly interface.
* Update task details as needed.
* Delete tasks you've completed.

**Features:**

* **SQLite Database Integration:** Leverages Room persistence library for local storage of tasks on your device.
* **Kotlin Coroutines:** Ensures a smooth user experience by performing database operations asynchronously.
* **ViewModel Architecture:** Separates UI data from UI logic for better maintainability.
